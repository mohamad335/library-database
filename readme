our project is to use a database with python
so we work on flask framework and sqlalchemy to create the database
the library is just simple version to take the title and author name and the rating 
so evry time i add the data and i quit the web the data will delete
here we create a database by use sqlalchemy and create a table to save our data or data user 
then we think that if we want to change the rate so we need to create a edit page to add the new create by update the new rating
